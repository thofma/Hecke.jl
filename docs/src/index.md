# Getting Started

Hecke.jl is a software package for the Julia programming language.
Currently, Hecke.jl requires that a Julia version of at least 1.0 is installed (the latest stable Julia version will do).
See <https://julialang.org/downlaods/> for instructions on how to install Julia for your system.

Once a suitable version of Julia is installed, users can start a Julia REPL (e.g. by typing `julia` in the command line) and
then enter the following commands to add Hecke.jl to their installation.

```julia
julia> using Pkg

julia> Pkg.add("Hecke")
```

Afterwards, to use Hecke.jl in Julia, users can simply include the `using Hecke` command at the beginning of any session.

```julia
julia> using Hecke
 _    _           _

|_|  |_|\___|\___|_|\_\___|  |  Version 0.37.6

julia>
```

Here's a quick example of using Hecke.jl to define a number field and compute its class group.

```jldoctest
julia> using Hecke

julia> Qx, x = QQ[:x];

julia> f = x^2 - 2*3*5*7;

julia> K, a = number_field(f, :a);

julia> OK = maximal_order(K);

julia> C, mC = class_group(OK);

julia> C
(Z/2)^2
```

Other examples of Hecke's usage can be found in the [How-to Guides](@ref) section of this website.
More in-depth resources are provided by our [Tutorials](@ref hecke_tutorials), which are guided walkthroughs to using Hecke, and by the [Manual](@ref), which gives a complete list of Hecke's implemented functionality.

# Features

Hecke currently provides functionliaty to enable a number of computations in number theory and commutative algebra. Some of the features implemented by Hecke include:

- Number fields (absolute, relative, simple and non-simple),
- Orders and ideals in number fields,
- Class and unit group computations of orders,
- Lattice enumeration,
- Sparse linear algebra,
- Class field theory,
- Abelian groups,
- Associative algebras,
- Ideals and orders in (semisimple) associative algebras,
- Locally free class groups of orders in semisimple algebras,
- Quadratic and Hermitian forms and lattices.

See the [Manual](@ref) for a complete list of implemented functionality.
