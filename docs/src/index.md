features:
  - title: What is Hecke?
    details: Hecke is a software package for computational algebraic number theory. It is written in julia and makes use of the computer algebra packages Nemo and AbstractAlgebra.
  - title: OSCAR
    details: Hecke is part of the [OSCAR](https://www.oscar-system.org/) system, which covers, in addition to number theory, also commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, group theory and polyhedral geometry.
