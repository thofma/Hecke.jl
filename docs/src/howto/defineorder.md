# Define an order in a number field

Usually, to create an order, one starts with a number field (respectively a defining polynomial):

```jldoctest 1
julia> Qx, x = QQ[:x];

julia> K, a = number_field(x^2 - 5, :a);
```

The number field is ``K = \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)``, where ``\alpha`` is a root of ``f = x^2 - 10``.
Since the polynomial ``f`` is integral, the ring ``\mathbb{Z}[\alpha]`` generated by ``\alpha`` is an order of ``K``.
This so-called *equation order* can be defined as follows:

```jldoctest 1
julia> E = equation_order(K)
Order
  of number field with defining polynomial x^2 - 5
    over rational field
with Z-basis [1, a]
```

The maximal order can be computed as:
```jldoctest 1
julia> maximal_order(K)
Maximal order
  of number field with defining polynomial x^2 - 5
    over rational field
with Z-basis [1, 1//2*a + 1//2]
```

We can also compute the order generated by a finite set of elements, that is,
the smallest order of ``K`` containing all elements:

```jldoctest 1
julia> order(K, [15*a, 10*a + 10])
Order
  of number field with defining polynomial x^2 - 5
    over rational field
with Z-basis [1, 5*a]
```

We can also supply a matrix containing the coordinates of a basis (as rows):
```jldoctest 1
julia> order(K, ZZ[1 0; 0 5])
Order
  of number field with defining polynomial x^2 - 5
    over rational field
with Z-basis [1, 5*a]
```
